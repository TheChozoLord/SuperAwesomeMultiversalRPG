The goal of the project was to create a basic RPG battle system for further expansion into a full fangame in the future.
In the title screen use the arrow keys to select what character you want to use and then press up to start or down to quit.
In the battle scene use S to use a special attack, or press a to use a regular attack.
I used Spyder for the code and Piskel for the sprites I made. For techniques I used dictionairys to create unique characters and caniballized the original TBC project code.
My little brother wyatt created all the sprites except for the agent 3 sprite and the background which were made by me.
I cant remember exactly what I learned but I know that I learned some stuff. I also learned that I need to go back through my code and make sure I dont accidentally name two variables the same thing.
I got stuck at several points where my code just died after a change. It was always because I had named two variables the same thing. I also had trouble passing varables from one scene to another.
I want to add animation primarialy. Make it look a little better. right now you dont really see anything happening. Then I would add a second enemy and the ability to have multiple characters in your party.
I dont really know what I would do differently next time. I just did the ideas that I had and havent had any other new ideas that would make it better yet.
My game design document was very broad so I didn't stray very far.
Coding this was so complicated I couldn't really stray very far from my game doc.
